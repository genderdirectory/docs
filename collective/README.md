# Introduction to the Collective

## Who can join the collective?

Anyone who contributes to our mission is considered a collective member. This could include working on items, a financial donation, or even advisory services.

## Why was this collective and project created?

For many years, various grassroots efforts have been made to compile lists of professionals who cater to the transgender community. This involves developing open-source software to create a website and managing its operations. The goal is to create a mobile-first, privacy-oriented, and internationalized website to serve the community globally. Our datasets will be made public and updated regularly, so even if this initiative fails, another team can carry out our work.
