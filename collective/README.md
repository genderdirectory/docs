# Introduction to the Collective

## What is the _Gender Directory Collective_?

The Gender Directory Collective, also known as "the Collective," is a group of individuals who contribute to the Gender Directory's open-source code or support the website's ongoing operations. The Collective is an open association, meaning that all of our work products, collected data sets, and finances are publicly available without any restrictions.

You can see our finances and contribute at [https://opencollective.com/genderdirectory](https://opencollective.com/genderdirectory)

## Who can join the collective?

Anyone who contributes to our mission is considered a collective member. This could include working on items, a financial donation, or even advisory services.

## Why was this collective and project created?

Over the years, many grassroots efforts have aimed to create lists of professionals who provide services to the transgender community. This involves developing open-source software for a website and managing its operations. The objective is to establish a mobile-first, privacy-focused, and globally accessible website to serve the community. Our datasets will be publicly available and regularly updated so that even if this project doesn't succeed, another team can continue our work.
