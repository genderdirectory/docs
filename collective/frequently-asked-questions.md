# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a collective?

A collective is a group of people or corporate entities that work together toward a common cause. Collectives include homeowner groups, amateur sports teams, clubs, associations, and related groups.

### What is an open collective?

An open collective is a group that openly shares its plans, budgets, and financial status to be completely transparent and open to the public. Anyone who contributes any resource—code, graphics, or a monetary donation—is considered a member of our open collective. We use a platform (actually called [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/)) where you can see _some_ updates ([we mainly have our blog for that](https://blog.genderdirectory.com/)) and our finances - our site is [https://opencollective.com/genderdirectory/](https://opencollective.com/genderdirectory/)

### What _is_ the cause of the collective?

We are dedicated to developing an open-source web application to support a freely accessible global directory of professionals who cater to or strongly support the transgender community. While the software can be developed through volunteer efforts, funding is required to maintain the servers hosting the site. Just like the transgender movement itself, our project is grassroots and community-driven.

**Every contributor to our source code or operations must agree to abide by the Contributors Covenant Code of Conduct** ([view the link to the code in our repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genderdirectory/genderdirectory/main/CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md) or [at the official website](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code\_of\_conduct/)). This code states that all contributors have an equal voice and will not be diminished based on physical traits, appearance, or experience. Everyone shall be treated as equals.

### Why an Open Collective?

Once again, we are returning to the grassroots transgender community. We believe it is important to be fully open and transparent about our operations when seeking community support. We depend entirely on donations and do not accept funding from providers for a "better" profile or any special treatment on the website.

### How Open Will You Be?

As stated before, all of our expenditures and payments will be publically documented and available for review at any time on our collective profile at [https://opencollective.com/genderdirectory](https://opencollective.com/genderdirectory).

The source code we develop will be released under the MIT License ([briefly explained here](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)), which is permissible for others to use for any reason. It will be freely available for download on GitHub under the [genderdirectory/genderdirectory](https://github.com/genderdirectory/genderdirectory) repository. The data we collect, except for any private user information we may collect in the future (that will be stripped from our dataset releases), will be available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license ([again, briefly explained here](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/creative-commons-cc0-1-0-universal)). We hope to release a full dataset every 24 hours on the GitHub repository [genderdirectory/datasets](https://github.com/genderdirectory/datasets).

### Who Currently Leads the Collective?

Our founder and leader is Paige Julianne Sullivan, who has nearly 30 years of experience as a software engineer. She has been instrumental in developing, releasing, and maintaining multiple open-source packages. In addition, she was an entrepreneur for eight years, developing a cloud-based phone system and voice carrier for medical facilities before selling the business.&#x20;

Sullivan is a REDCap software engineer and administrator for METRC, Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium, based at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Additionally, she serves as a staff representative and co-chair of the university-wide Trans Awareness Task Force, which develops executive recommendations to improve the experience for all trans-identified affiliates (students, staff, and faculty). &#x20;

Moreover, Sullivan was selected to participate in the Spring 2025 Academy for Women and Leadership cohort at the esteemed Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business in Baltimore, Maryland. Her LinkedIn profile can be found at [https://pj14.co/linkedin](https://pj14.co/linkedin), and her blog at [https://pj14.co/](https://pj14.co/).
